# Results Overview — Phase 2C.6 baseline + follow-on lanes

This page is the single-entry reporting surface for the completed 2C.6 baseline refresh and the follow-on reviewer lanes.

The Tier 1 corpus refresh is now complete; pair-eval / ROC / E2E sections remain intentionally `TBD` until those lanes execute.

## Source of truth

## 4) Pair eval

This section is for the follow-on `[B-1]` lane. It should be populated only from
pair-labeled vuln/patched runs that come from extraction-success inputs.

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| pair corpus size | `7` |
| vuln targets | `7` |
| patched targets | `7` |
| recall | `0.142857` |
| false-positive rate | `0.142857` |
| label source | `target cve_id present in stages/cve_scan/cve_matches.json` |
| exclusions | `0` |

### Pair corpus notes

- Full candidate list and CVE mapping is in `docs/pair_corpus_candidates.md` (10 candidate pairs + 2 gaps documented).
- **Current local-7 set** (baseline-reuse, 7 pairs / 14 runs):
  - Netgear R7000 V1.0.7.12 → V1.0.9.34 (CVE-2017-5521)
  - D-Link DIR-868L K02 → K04 (CVE-2018-10970 ref)
  - D-Link DIR-850L FW105 → FW115 (CVE-2019-20213 / CVE-2019-6258 ref)
  - D-Link DIR-825 B1 FW201 → FW202 (CVE-2017-6190 ref)
  - D-Link DIR-825 C1 FW301 → FW304 (CVE-2019-6257 ref)
  - TP-Link Archer C7 v2 2015 → 2016 (CVE-2017-13772 ref)
  - TP-Link Archer C7 v4 2017 → 2018 (CVE-2019-17152 ref)
- **Gaps** requiring external sourcing (see `docs/benchmark_pair_gap.md`):
  - DIR-859 pre-1.06B01 (vuln-side missing locally)
  - OpenWrt Archer C7 v5 pre-23.05 (baseline control missing)
- **Exclusions**: any pair whose vuln-side fails extraction (`partial` or worse) must be held back; only `extraction=ok` subset feeds the pair-labeled recall/FPR calculation. This aligns with the "pipeline capable ≠ value delivered" framing.
- **Pair type**: all M0 pairs are **version-paired** within the same vendor model line. Patch-level pairs (minor build number diffs) are parked under §5 of `docs/pair_corpus_candidates.md` as P3 future expansion.
- **Local-7 actual numbers are now populated** from `benchmark-results/pair-eval/pair_eval_summary.json`. Gap pairs (e.g. DIR-859) remain a follow-on expansion step.

## 5) Calibration

This section is for the `[C]` lane.

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| confidence threshold / cap | `0.78` (single observed local-7 point) |
| ROC / PR source | `benchmark-results/pair-eval/pair_eval_summary.json` |
| calibration subset | `7 pairs / 14 success runs` |
| TP | `1` |
| FP | `1` |
| TN | `6` |
| FN | `6` |

### Calibration notes

- The local-7 run still produced a **degenerate single-threshold ROC point** because every pair-side resolved to the same top vulnerability finding (`web.exec_sink_overlap`, `confidence=0.78`, `evidence_tier=symbol_only`).
- The current curve is **pair-subset only** (7 local pairs / 14 runs), not corpus-wide.
- Only `extraction=ok` / `inventory=sufficient` runs were scored; no runs were excluded in M0.

## 6) E2E demo

R7000 2C.2 smoke run anchor: `aiedge-runs/2026-04-13_1014_sha256-b28bf08e9d2c`. Full walk-through is in `docs/r7000_e2e_demo.md`. Below is the high-level index so this page can stay the single-entry reference.

### Step 1 — static finding

- input artifact: `aiedge-inputs/netgear/R7000-V1.0.11.136_10.2.120.chk`
- stage output: `stages/findings/findings.json` (3 findings, reasoning_trail_count=1)
- primary finding: `aiedge.findings.web.exec_sink_overlap` (category=vulnerability, severity=high, confidence=0.78, priority_score=0.465)
- affected binaries: `squashfs-root/opt/rcagent/cgi/rccommand.cgi`, `/opt/remote/bin/RMT_invite.cgi`, `/usr/sbin/httpd`

### Step 2 — LLM triage

- input artifact: same `stages/findings/findings.json`
- reasoning trace: `findings[0].reasoning_trail` has 5 entries — `synthesis_match` → `fp_verification.llm_verdict=maintain` (sonnet) → `adversarial_triage.advocate=exploit_path_plausible` (sonnet) → `adversarial_triage.critic=downgrade` (sonnet) → `adversarial_triage.decision=downgrade` (Δ -0.2, confidence 0.550 → 0.350)
- verdict artifacts: `stages/fp_verification/stage.json` (100 artifacts), `stages/adversarial_triage/stage.json` (201 artifacts)

### Step 3 — emulation

- input artifact: `stages/emulation/stage.json` (status=ok, 1 artifact)
- execution artifact: `stages/emulation/emulation.log`
- observation: lightweight FirmAE profile ran to completion; dynamic_validation downstream is `partial` (10 artifacts, `stages/dynamic_validation/dynamic_validation.json`)

### Step 4 — fuzzing

- input artifact: `stages/fuzzing/stage.json`
- fuzz artifact: none on this run
- observation: **fuzzing=skipped** on this run — time/tooling budget outside the 2C.2 smoke scope. Pipeline wiring is verified (stage registered, dry-run config parses) but no fuzz campaign was executed. Fuzz-to-crash lane deferred to a follow-on run documented in `docs/r7000_e2e_demo.md` §8.

### Step 5 — exploit-chain hypothesis

- input artifact: `stages/chain_construction/chains.json` (50 chains, summary: `{same_binary: 50, llm_generated: 3, cross_binary: 0, total: 50}`)
- chain artifact: `stages/exploit_chain/milestones.json` (3 milestones, `exploit_gate: {scope: lab-only, flag: lab, attestation: authorized}`, `milestones[0].reachability=partial`)
- conclusion: verdict state = `inconclusive` with `missing_exploit_bundle` reason. `stages/poc_validation/poc_validation.json` status=failed with block reason `POLICY_PREREQ_STAGE_ARTIFACT_MISSING` — this is the **governance fail-closed** signal, not a system error.
